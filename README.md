Most-probable-trajectories-in-the-delayed-tumor-growth-model-excited-by-a-multiplicative-non-Gaussia.m aims to obtain the most probable trajectories;
PDF.f90 gets the one-step-transition matrix;
MPT1.f90 obtains the first transition probability density function;
MPT2.f90 obtains the second transition probability density function.
